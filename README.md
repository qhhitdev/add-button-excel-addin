To use this code:

Open Excel and press Alt + F11 to open the Visual Basic Editor.
Insert a new module by clicking on "Insert" and then "Module".
Copy and paste the code into the new module.
Save the Excel file as an add-in by selecting "File" > "Save As" and choosing the "Excel Add-In (*.xlam)" file format.
Close the Visual Basic Editor.
Go to Excel's "Add-Ins" tab and click on "Browse" to locate and select the add-in file you just saved.
Once the add-in is loaded, you should see a custom button labeled "Custom Button" in the "Add-Ins" tab of the Ribbon.
Clicking on the custom button will trigger the CustomButton_Click subroutine, which in this example displays a message box saying "Custom button clicked!".
